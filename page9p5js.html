            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is my project – an interactive typography experiment where the letters move, shift, and interact with each other. I’ve been playing around with tools like textToPoints() and lerp() to get the motion right. It's been cool figuring out how small adjustments in timing and movement can change the whole vibe. Still working on it, but I’ve learned that every single point or numbers could be very important in changing a certain code!" </p>
